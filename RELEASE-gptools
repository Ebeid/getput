0.1.3   Jan 23, 2014

    the url connection scheme as well as the port. applies to
    both authurl as well as preauthurl for talking directly
    to proxies
  - added new switch, --insecure
  - honor OA_CACERT if defined

0.1.2   Oct 14, 2014
  - added new switches:
    - retries will override the number of operation retries applied
      during normal operations, the default value of which is 5
    - sleeps allows one to sleep between tests, sets of tests and
      sets of processes
  - include number of tries in exception reporting as well as with
    -d32
  - clean up the drift detection code to make errors more explicit AND
    to check against clock on the machine running gpsuite
  - gpmulti should NOT try to run getput in ./
  - cleanup/clarification of --preauthtoken usage in manpage
  - when using flat hierarchies with getput, you MUST includle -n

0.1.1	Jun 24, 2014
  - discovered BOTH tenane_id and _name must exist in dictionary
    for V2 authentication to work

0.1.0   May 20, 2014
  - use setup.py to install
  - removed .py extensions

0.0.8   Feb 26, 2014
  - new getput/gpmulti switch: exclog
  - new conf file options for gpsuite
    --exclogs set to 1 to request getput to generate exception log
    --postargs specifies arguments to be included with --posttest script
  - added -p to posttest API as the logfile timestamp prefix to make it
    possible for script to find logfile when multiple ones in same dir
  - needed to optionally add tenant_name to opts if only it defined

0.0.7	Feb 18, 2014
  - Added support for using swiftclient's close() method which was not
    available with V1.5
  - expects transaction IDs to always be there now

0.0.6  Jan 7, 2013
  - sleep for 0.01 secs (without multiplying by instance) for container
    creation as including it had an unwanted multiplicative effect
  - include container names with -d32
  - added getting-started.txt to docs/

0.0.5  Dec 9, 2013
  - wasn't proerly loading tenant_id and tenant_name from creds file
  - the test for newAPI shouldn't just be based on the connection
    succeeding as I've seen it succeed and still no transIDs available
    so make sure 'response_dict' is an arg to put_object

0.0.4
  - looks like I messed up the syntax of the unexpected error printing
    around line 1650,  I really don't like pep8!

0.0.3
  - if any of cname, oname, creds or nodes are not specified in conf file
    use 'type' to generate default values.  consider us of  --dry to verify
  - new conf option: csv=1 will report all results in csv format

0.0.2
  - removed some extraneous debugging print statements from getput
  - added command line to log file
  - added a test inside the ping loop to measure clock drift and make
    sure within acceptable limits
  - remove py extentions after moving into place
  - added 'getting started doc', still needs gpsuite section

  - Initial Release
